## Course Revenue Optimization & Engagement Analysis
#### Leveraging Excel Analytics to Drive Strategic Course Monetization for an EdTech Platform

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
LearnX is a rapidly growing EdTech company founded in 2019 with a mission to democratize high-quality online learning for professionals, students, and lifelong learners worldwide. With a course catalog exceeding 6,000+ digital offerings, the platform provides accessible, affordable education across subjects like Web Development, Business Finance, Graphic Design, and Musical Instruments.

The company operates on a freemium-to-premium model, where beginner-level courses are free to drive engagement and platform onboarding, while intermediate to advanced content is monetized via subscription and one-time pricing tiers.

### PROJECT QUESTIONS
1. What is the total number of subscribers in each subject?
2. How does the average content duration/price/number of students vary across different subjects?
3. How many courses are free and paid for each subject?
4. What is the average price of web development courses at different levels?
5. Does course duration impact the price of the course?

  ## PROCESSES
  ### STEP 1: DATA COLLECTION AND EXPLORATION
  ##### TOOLS: EXCEL
  
  - Imported and combined multiple Excel sheets through a process called Data onsolidation.
  - Verified dataset completeness, format types, and inconsistencies.
  - Examined for column headers, null values, data types (numeric, date, text).
  - Explore and understand the structure and scope of the dataset.


 ### STEP 2: DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION
 ##### TOOLS: EXCEL
 
 - Removed duplicates using Excel.
 - Filtered and removed rows with missing critical values.
 - Created helper columns
 - Ensure the dataset is consistent, error-free, and analysis-ready.

### STEP 3: ANALYSIS (EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS)
##### TOOLS: EXCEL

- Having a deeper delve by using Descriptive Statistics to spot errors  not obvious and have a comprehensive idea about the data set.
- Defined relationship between tables by using pivot tables.
- Answered business questions using calculations, logic, and aggregation.

  
### STEP 4: DATA VISUALIZATION 
##### TOOLS: TABLEAU

Communicate findings with clarity using charts, summaries, and narratives.

1. Created visualizations:

- Bar charts for subscriber totals by subject.

- Clustered column charts for average values by subject.

- Pie charts for free vs paid distribution.

- Scatter plot for price vs duration.

2. Highlighted:

- Top-performing subjects

- Price sensitivity

- Popular beginner-level free courses


### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### STEP 5. SHARE (INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS)

Suggest strategies and actions based on insights to guide stakeholders which includes the following;

##### INSIGHTS

 1. **Subscriber Distribution by Subject**: The Web Development has the most number of subscribers. Almost 67% if you calculate that. Followed by Business Finance. The number of subscribers for the other two subjects is significantly lower compared to Web Development. These subjects have high demand â€” ideal for launching new courses or premium content

 2. **Average Price, Duration & Student Count by Subject**: Web Development may command higher prices and longer durations. Use this to benchmark pricing strategies per subject. Business Finance courses might be shorter but attract large enrollments due to accessibility as it comparably matches the Web Development returns. Consider offering micro-courses in low-duration categories that still yield high value.

 3. **Does Course Duration Impact Price?**
There may be a moderate positive correlation: longer courses may charge higher prices, but not always. Pricing should reflect not just duration, but value, subject matter, and level. Consider tiered pricing based on content length and depth.
    
##### RECOMMENDATIONS

 - Increasing advanced-level content in top-performing subjects.

- Bundling free beginner courses with paid follow-ups.

- Pricing optimization based on course length and subject category.

- Promoting shorter-duration, highly-rated beginner content to boost enrollments.
